        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p>University of Toronto- Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science - Software Engineering stream</p>
        <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
        <h3>Software Engineer 2 - Oracle: Mar 2020 - Present</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focused on backend development, support and maintenance for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic - Compute Images team using Python, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Jenkins, Hudson, Docker, chef and internal tools.</li>
            <li>Reduced compute images security scans runtime by more than 2/3 by efficiently creating a single instance that can run multiple types of scans.</li>
            <li>Created metrics generation script for CPU and memory usage for groups of processes, that are emitted to the monitoring system for visual analysis; Alarms were created to alert any drastic changes in CPU and mem usage.</li>
            <li>Created scripts and a pipeline to automate building any compute image using server owned by Compute Images team, resulting in much more flexibility and efficiency for modifying, patching, and releasing new compute images.</li>
            <li>Implemented various diagnostics that caught issues with unreachable Higgs Gateways 100% of the time, as well as active node reporting inconsistencies between 2 different reporting mechanisms.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Software Engineer - Onclusive: July 2018 - July 2019</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focused on backend engineering for the Analytics team for a Data Science and Technology driven software used to measure
                the impact of Public Relations.</li>
            <li>Technologies used include Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, Elastic Search, Hirefire, Amazon S3, Sumo Logic, RSpec and Heroku.</li>
            <li>Enhanced event tracking from Google Analytics to be able to track both Event Actions and Event Goals (implemented changes
                in the frontend as well).</li>
            <li>Implemented filtering by Google Analytics “Account Id” and “Web Property” on the Analytics Integration Page for Customer
                Success Managers to easily integrate the customer profile to their Google Analytics view (included frontend changes)</li>
            <li>Enhanced python Plot.ly dashboards to query certain fields from Elastic Search instead of MySQL which cut the loading and
                rendering time to about 1/10 (included frontend changes)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cloud Analytics Software Developer - SAP: July 2016 - July 2018</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focused on frontend and backend designing, coding, testing, debugging, documentation, implementation and quality assurance of data integration for Business Intelligence, Planning and Predictive software, SAP Analytics Cloud (formerly known as Business Objects Cloud), using ECMA 5/6 (Javascript), XSJSLib, HTML, CSS, SAPUI5, and SAP HANA.</li>
            <li>Implemented a Queue Manager to synchronize frontend/backend requests which resulted in a 100% reduction for read/write
                collision errors which enhanced product reliability and stability.</li>
            <li>Improved performance of column mapping inference by 87% and enhanced the feature to use various algorithms (e.g.
                Levenshtein) to accommodate automatic mapping of columns to dimensions and properties in the model; covering all
                commonly used dataset types and models. The product’s performance in terms of speed and efficiency, and the user
                experience was substantially increased.</li>
            <li>Implemented an aggregation/rejection of measures feature for importing data into an existing model where the rows being
                imported already exist in the model which improved code stability.</li>
        </ul>
